# Taylor Phillips: Project 1-Matching PAR-ty

## **Game Description**

**Matching PAR-ty**
This is a Memory Matching golf themed game. You will start with 16 cards and you must flip cards until you get all cards to match (8 sets). Press the start button to begin the game and start watching the time tick down. If you are able to get all matches before the times runs out you have hit a "HOLE-IN-ONE". If the time runs out before you match all the cards, you will have hit a "DOUBLE BOGEY", OH NO!! If you find a match great job, but all cards will turn over when you find a mis-match and will have to start again (this is where you must rely on your memory). Also, when you click the first card and your second card is not a match, the second card will not flip(adding to your challenge). If you get frustrated or want to reset your time, hit the reset button and try again from full time(120 seconds).

This screenshot demonstrates what you will see when you first open up the game. You can see your start button, your reset button, flip counter and your cards.

Look! You made your first match. Once you make another selection and those cards don't match, you will have to start looking for matches again.

You did it! You have matched all cards and you can see the "HOLE-IN-ONE" message.

You didn't get all the matches before time ran out! This screenshot shows the message "DOUBLE BOGEY". Now to restart the game and try again!


## **Technologies Used**

I used HTML to make the display of my game. The HTML included my images for the game, my start/restart button, my timer and my flip counter.

I used CSS to decorate and organize my HTML. I used CSS grid to align my cards into a grid pattern of 4x4. I also used CSS to style the font of my game title, buttons, timer and flip counter. Also, used CSS to allign my title, buttons, timer and flip counter in their designated positions.

I used Javascript to build my game. I used conditional statements to check for card matches and mismatches. I created functions that would allow for my cards to flip, cards to be matched, unmatched cards and checking for the matches. I displayed my victory message and game over message by using DOM manipulation. DOM manipulation was also key for the ability to click the cards and to locate information needed for the game to run (start button, restart button, timer and flip counter). Finally, I built functions to start my timer countdown and to remove flip from cards when they were not matched.

## **Next Steps**

I had a blast making this game. However, there are steps I would like to make to polish my game. First, I would like to make animations for when cards match. I want to see the cards rubberband or shake when they are matched. Also, I want to add a hover style, so when the user hovers their mouse above the card it raises slightly. I also want to improve on the functionality of the game. The game runs fine in it's current state, but I can make my code more dry and add more functions to help the game run smoother. For example, adding in a shufflecard feature to add different dynamics to the game.
